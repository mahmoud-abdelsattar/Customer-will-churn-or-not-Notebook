# Customer-will-churn-or-not-Notebook

## Model Evaluation and Validation
## Project: Predicting churn or not Using Logistic Regression

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Customer will churn or not!!.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the `churn_train.csv` dataset file to complete your work , you will see implemented functionality requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Customer will churn or not!!.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Customer will churn or not!!.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset in the notebook consists of clean data that required for the prediction process.

**Features**
Data fields

• Total Spend in Months 1 and 2 of 2017: The total spend of a customer in the months July & August 2017.

• Total SMS Spend: The total spend on SMS by a customer revenue earned through the SMS service used by the subscriber.

• Total Data Spend: The total amount spend on Data/Internet by a customer revenue earned through the SMS service used by the subscriber.

• Total Data Consumption : The total data consumed by a subscriber in KB over the period under study

• Total Unique Calls: The total count of unique calls made by a subscriber during the period under review

• Total Onnet spend: The total spend of a customer to make on-network calls (on the same network as the subscriber)

• Total Offnet spend: Aggregate of Off Net Revenue: The total spend of a customer to make off-network calls (not the same network as the subscriber)

• Customer Tenure in Months: The time passed since the subscriber started using the services of the network provider and counted in months

• Network type subscription in Month 1: This indicates preferred network subscription of a customer, which may indicate their type of device - 2G or 3G service.

• Network type subscription in Month 2: This indicates preferred network subscription of a customer, which may indicate their type of device - 2G or 3G service in the month after.

• Total Call centre complaint calls: The number of complaints made by the subscribers.

• Most Loved Competitor network in in Month 1: This information certainly have a huge impact on as it gives the information about which other service provider prefer and may likely move to

• Most Loved Competitor network in in Month 2: This information certainly have a huge impact on as it gives the information about which other service provider prefer and may likely move to

**Target Variable**
• Churn Status: This is an indicator of a customer who leaves the network or not. 1 means the customer has churned and 0 means no churn.
